# Progressive Intent Skill
Turn the human's observation of a running result into the next minimum intent delta.

- Take feedback as given ("keep this", "too complicated", "don't change the backend"). Do not ask for a rewritten specification.
- Append a delta to `intent/current-feature.md` using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/delta-template.md`. Use only the sections needed.
- Record what stays as carefully as what changes. An explicit "don't touch" is a New Boundary.
- Do not rewrite the original intent, and do not plan the implementation here; that is the feature planner's job.
- If the observation asks for nothing further, the answer is Stop.
